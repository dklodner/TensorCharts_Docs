Trades heatmap, also called footprint charts, is a visualization of trading activity inside each candle and show the distribution of buying and selling activity. 

TensorCharts aggregates every trade on multiple price levels. It allows you to track volume and order flow in much greater detail. The Heatmap also can reveal hidden orders, visualize buying/selling pressure exhaustion and trend reversals.

### Delta and Buy/Sell mode
You can toggle between two modes, 
1. delta mode   
2. buy/sell mode

The delta shows you the difference between buy/sell volume at each price level. Mode buttons can be found in settings panel right next to trades heatmap opacity slider.
