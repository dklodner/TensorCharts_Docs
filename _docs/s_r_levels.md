Support and resistance levels are derived from the trades heatmaps. They show you levels with the largest traded volume in current date range. Unlike volume profile, S/R levels don’t aggregate volume and don’t sum volume points on the same price level. They can help uncover hidden orders.

The number of S/R levels in the settings panel defines how many levels to show, starting from the largest traded volume
