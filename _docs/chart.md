### Timeframes
Since heatmaps are very heavy on the graphs, the time frames included for now are limited to:
- 1 Day
- 4 Hours
- 1 Hour
- 15 Minutes
- 5 Minutes
- Real-time

Heatmaps are not easily calculated as normal candlesticks. Therefore, at this time, options are limited to the above-mentioned, 6, timeframes.

### Real-time chart
The Real-time chart is a recreation of the order book in real time.  Since the graph will develop with the price action, once you initiate this timeframe, you will need to wait for the data to load. The precision of the heatmap will depend on precision of the order book. You can change the precision with + / - buttons in the top menu of order book or by changing order book heatmap precision,  buttons 1 / 2 right next to orderbook heatmap opacity slider.

Real-time chart is being recreated from orderbook in real time thus you need to wait for the data to load. Precision of the heatmap depends on current orderbook precision. You can change precision with + / - buttons in the top menu of orderbook or by changing orderbook heatmap precision,  buttons 1 / 2 right next to orderbook heatmap opacity slider.

### Chart type
TensorCharts has three types of chart -  candlesticks,  heikin ashi, and  renko charts. You can easily toggle between them with the button right next to timeframes options or with key H. The three chart types can be defined as follows:

1. *Candlesticks* : The most widely used tool in all of technical analysis, it simply graphs four data points of any given period: high, low, opening price, and closing price.
2. *Heikin ashi* : Modified candles, best suited for trend riding as they take data from the previous period to portray momentum of the current period. Look for a doji or a shift between bullish and bearish candles to suggest a trend reversal or a point to exit the market and take your profits.
2. *Renko* : It diminishes noise by isolating price from time. Each brick is formed if fixed increments or decrements in price are achieved. Renko in TensorCharts is calculated using the average true range (ATR 14). Renko needs more data, zoom in and out the chart to load more data.

By default, visibility of candles is limited to outlines so it wouldn’t cover trades heatmap. To switch visibility, hit **key C** or click on candlestick icon button near chart type button.

More precise settings of candlesticks’ visibility can be controlled by trades heatmap opacity slider. Try to move the slider to its extremes.

#### Move 
Mouse - left click and drag
<br/>
Touchpad - two fingers and horizontal slide

#### Zoom
Mouse - scroll wheel
<br/>
Touchpad - two fingers and vertical slide
<br/>
Zoom buttons in the middle of chart

Price range can be also adjusted by dragging Y axis. It’s useful to see important supply zones further from visible range. Be aware custom price range turns off autoscaling. To reset it back to default settings, click on the reload button in between zoom buttons.
