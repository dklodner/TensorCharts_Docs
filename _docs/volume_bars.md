The advantage of TensorCharts data processing is the ability to study volume in detail and to see both sides of the market. This also applies to volume bars showing traded volume during each interval. 

### Delta or Sell/Buy bars
Each volume consists of a shaded larger bar, which is the total traded volume, and brighter bars for either:

-	delta volume, or
-	two bars for each buy and sell volume

The mode of volume bars is dependent on the trades heatmap mode - see the description of trades heatmap.

<p>Look for volume extreme spikes, they often lead to trend reversal moments. On the other side, continuous grow of the volume leads to form stable trend move.</p>
