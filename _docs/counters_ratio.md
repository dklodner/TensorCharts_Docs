#### Counter’s ratio chart
To plot Trades Counter development related to price and time history in separated bubble chart -  the Counter Ratio - click on the chart pictogram button.

This is a visual representation of the action seen in the Trades Counter. Though still an experimental indicator, it functions similarly to an oscillator that gives a sense of when buyers are overtaking sellers, or vice versa. 

Look for an increase in the size of the circles, as the larger ones represent overbought or oversold conditions, especially when price action remains in lull. Alternatively, the counter’s ratio can provide signals of euphoria (to the upside) or capitulation (to the downside) once a strong trending move is taking place.

Click on the chart pictogram button on the desired Trades Counter. Deselect the previously selected counter by clicking on the chart pictogram button again.
